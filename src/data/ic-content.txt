Key Features of the Indian Constitution
The Indian Constitution of Class 8
What were Ideals, goals and milestones in front of the Constitution Making Assembly ?
During the freedom struggle the nationalists had devoted a great deal of time to imagining and planning what a free India would be like. Under the British, they had been forced to obey rules that they had very little role in making. The long experience of authoritarian rule under the colonial state convinced Indians that free India should be a democracy in which everyone should be treated equally and be allowed to participate in government.
What remained to be done then was to workout the ways in which a democratic government would beset up in India and the rules that would determine its functioning. This was done not by one person but by a group of around 300 people who became members of the ConstituentAssembiy in 1946 and who met periodically for the next three years to write India's Constitution. Finally the constitution was passed by the constituent assembly on 26 November 1949.
When the constitution was being written, India was going through considerable turmoil. The partition of the country into India and Pakistan was imminent, some of the Princely States remained undecided about their future, and the socio- economic condition of the vast mass of people appeared dismal. All these issues played on the minds of the members of the Constituent Assembly as they drafted the Constitution. They rose to the occasion and gave this country a visionary document that reflects a respect for maintaining diversity while preserving national unity.
The final document also reflects their concern for eradicating poverty through socio-economic reforms as well as emphasizing the crucial role the people can play in choosing their representatives.
Key Features of the Indian Constitution
Keeping above factors in mind, the framers of Indian constitution tried to balance these concerns such as diversity, unity, socio economic reform and representation with their commitment to transforming independent India into a strong democratic society.

Federal Features
This refers to the existence of more than one level of government in the country. In India, we have governments at the state level and at the centre. Panchayati Raj is the third tier of government. The vast number of communities in India meant that a system of government needed to be devised that did riot involve only parsons sitting in the capital city of New Delhi and making decisions for everyone. Instead, it was important to have another level of government in the states so that decisions could be made for that Particular area. While each state in India enjoys autonomy in exercising powers on certain issues; subjects of national concern require that all of these states follow the laws of the central government.
The Constitution demarcates the powers of the central and the state government into different lists of subjects. These lists are called the Union list, the State list and the Concurrent list.
Subjects of nationai importance like defence, foreign affairs, atomic energy, banking, post and telegraph are included in the Union List. The central government can pass laws on the subjects mentioned in the union list. The union list has 99 subjects.
The State List comprises those important subjects on which the state government can pass laws. Subjects like police, local government, trade and commerce within the state, agriculture are included in the State List. The State List has 66 subjects.
In order to avoid any kind of ambiguity in the distribution of functions, the Constitution provides for a third list which is called concurrent List. These are the subjects which are of common concern both to the centre and the state governments. The Concurrent list has got 52 subjects.
In addition the constitution also specifies where each tier of government can get the money from for the work that it does. Under federalism, the states are not merely agents of the federal government but draw their authority from the constitution as well. All persons in India are governed by laws and policies made by each of these levels of government.
Parliamentary form of Government
The different tiers of government consist of representatives who are elected by the people. The Constitution of India guarantees universal adult suffrage for all citizens. When they were making the Constitution, the members of the Constituent Assembly felt that the freedom struggle had prepared the masses for universal adult suffrage and that this would help encourage a democratic mindset and break the clutches of traditional caste, class and gender hierarchies.

This means that the people of India have a direct role in electing their representatives. Also, every citizen of the country, irrespective of his/her social background, can also contest in elections. These representatives are accountable to the people.

Seperation of Powers
According to the Constitution, there are three organs of the State. These are the legislature, the executive and the Judiciary. The legislature refers to our elected representatives. The executive is a smaller group of people who are responsible for implementing laws and running the government.

The judiciary refers to the system of courts in this country. In order to prevent the misuse of power by any one branch of the State, the Constitution says that each of these organs should exercise different powers. Through this, each organ acts as a check on the other organs of the State and this ensures the balance of power between all three.

Fundamentals of Rights
The section on Fundamental Rights has often been referred to as the 'conscience' of the Indian Constitution. Fundamental Rights, protect citizens against the arbitrary and absolute exercise of power by the State. The Constitution, thus, guarantees the rights of individuals against the State as well as against other individuals.

The Constitution classifies the fundamental rights under seven groups. According to 44th amendment of Constitution, the right to property is now a legal right. Recently there are 6 Fundamental Rights. These are as follows -

Types of Fundamentals of Rights
Right to Equality : All persons are equal before the law. This means that all persons shall be equally protected by the laws of the country. It also states that no citizen can be discriminated against on the basis of their religion, caste or sex. Every person has access to all public places including playgrounds, hotels, shops etc. The States cannot discriminate against anyone in matters of employment. But there are exceptions to this. The Constitution provides for special provisions in the form of reserve posts while guaranteeing right to equality. Reserve posts are provided for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes. Similarly, special provisions are provided for women and children. The practice of untouchability has also been abolished.
Right to Freedom : This includes the right to freedom of speech and expression, the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, the right to form associations or unions, the right to move freely through­out the territory of India, the right to reside in any part of the country, and the right to practice any profession, occupation or business.
Right against Exploitation : The Constitution prohibits human trafficking, forced labour, and children working under 14 years of age.
Right to Freedom of Religion : Religious freedom is provided to all citizens. Every person has the right to practice, profess and propagate the religion of his \ her choice.
Cultural and Educational Rights : The Constitution states that all minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own educational institutions in order to preserve and develop their own culture.
Right to Constitutional Remedies : This allows citizens to move the court if they believe that any of their Fundamental Rights have been violated by the State.
Protection of Minorities
Moreover, the various minority communities also expressed the need to include rights that would protect minority group. The Constitution, therefore, also guarantees the rights of minorities against the majority. As Dr. Ambedkar has said about these Fundamental Rights, their object is two-fold. The first objective is that every citizen must be in a position to claim those rights. And secondly, these rights must be binding upon every authority that has got the power to make laws.

Directive Principles of  State Policy
In addition to Fundamental Rights, the Constitution also has a section called Directive Principles of State Policy. This section was designed by the members of the Constituent Assembly to ensure greater social and economic reform and to serve as a guide to the independent Indian State to institute laws and policies that help to reduce the poverty of the masses.

Securalism
India is a secular state. All citizens, irrespective of their religious beliefs are equal in the eyes of the law. The government cannot formulate such policies which discriminate between various religious communities which live in India.

The Fundamental Rights
The Fundamental Rights are a crucial part of the Indian Constitution and are enshrined in Part III, Articles 12 to 35. These rights guarantee certain basic freedoms and protections to every citizen of India, ensuring individual liberty, equality, and justice. The framers of the Constitution considered Fundamental Rights as the cornerstone of a democratic and just society, providing citizens with the means to challenge any arbitrary actions of the state and safeguard their dignity and rights. Here is an overview of the Fundamental Rights of the Indian Constitution:
 
1.Definition of State (Article 12)
State includes the following:
Government and Parliament of India (Unions executive and legislative organs)
Government and legislatures of the States
Local Authorities (e.g. district boards, PRIs, ULBs, etc)
Other authorities, statutory or non-statutory (e.g. LIC, ONGC)
SC: Article 12 includes even private bodies working as an instrument of the State
The actions of these agencies can be challenged in court for violating FRs.
Article 13
Provides for judicial review; all Laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of any FR shall be void.
Supreme Court under Article 32 and High Court under Article 226 have the power of judicial reviews.
“Law” for the purposes of Article 13 is→ Laws enacted by legislatures, ordinances, Executive legislation like order, bye-laws, rule- regulation or notification, Custom or usage having the force of Laws
Article 13 does not define a CA as a Law, but SC said that a CA can be challenged for violating an FR that forms a part of the basic structure of the Constitution (Keshavananda Bharati case, 1973).
2.Right to Equality (Articles 14-18):
This right ensures equality before the law and prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. It guarantees equal protection of laws to all citizens and prohibits any form of untouchability. It also abolishes titles except for military or academic distinctions.
 
Article 14: Equality before the Law or the Equal Protection of Law

It provides that the state- shall not deny to any person equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.
Two aspects are at hand:
1. Equality before Law:
2. Equal Protection of Law
 
Equality Before Law (British Origin + Negative connotation):
Absence of any special privileges in favor of any person;
Equal subjection of all persons to ordinary law of land administered by ordinary law courts;
No person is above the law.
Equal Protection of Law (American Origin + positive notion):
Equality of treatment under equal circumstances, both in privileges conferred and liabilities
imposed by the laws;
Similar application of the same laws to all persons who are similarly situated; Like, should be treated alike without any discrimination.
Art.14 forbids class legislation, it permits the reasonable classification of persons, objects and
transactions by the law.
Confers right to all persons (citizens and foreigners) and includes Legal Persons.
Rule of Law (by A V Dicey) (a basic feature of the constitution): the concept of ‘Equality before Law’ is an element of the Rule of Law.

Rule of Law has 3 fundamental principles:
Absence of arbitrary power – applicable to the Indian System.
Equality before the law – applicable to the Indian System
The primacy of individual rights – not applicable, as the constitution is the source of individual rights.
Exceptions to Equality:
President of India and Governor, Foreign sovereigns and diplomats, UNO and its agencies.
Art 31C: SC held that where “Art 31C comes in, Art 14 goes out”.
Art 361A: No person is liable for any civil or criminal proceedings in any court in respect of publication in news reports of true reports of any proceedings of parliament or the state legislature.
Art 105: Parliamentary privilege of members of parliament.
Art 194: Privileges of members of the state legislature in the legislature or any committee thereof.
Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination on certain grounds
 
The state shall not discriminate against any citizen only on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
No citizen shall be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction, or condition on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth with regard to
Access to shops, public restraints, hotels, and places of public entertainment
The use of wells, talks, bathing Ghats, roads places of public resort dedicated to the use of the general public or maintained wholly or partially by the state
Thus, under the second provision, discrimination by both the state and private individuals is prohibited.
Exceptions to non-discrimination:
Special provisions for women and children
Special provisions for the advancement of social and educational backward classes of citizens or for SCs and STs regarding their admission to educational institutions, aided or unaided by the state, except minority educational institutions (93rd CA 2005).
Centre enacted the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act 2006 to give a 27% quota to OBCs.
2008: SC directed the central government to exclude the creamy layer of OBCs while implementing the law.
Article 16: Equality of Opportunity in Matters of Public Employment
It stands for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of employment or appointment to any office under the State.
There would be unbiased treatment amongst the citizens for any employment or office under the State on grounds of only religion, race, caste, sex and descent, place of birth, or residence.
Exceptions
In a state or union territory, a municipal government, or another authority, residence may be required as a condition of employment or appointment. Except for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act of 1957, which expired in 1974, there is no such provision for any state.
Reservation of appointments can be provided by the state in support of any backward class that is not adequately represented in the state services.
A law can offer that the incumbent of an office related to a religious or denominational institution or a member of its governing body should belong to a particular religion or denomination.
Provision for the reservation of up to 10% of appointments or posts has been permitted to the states in support of any economically weaker sections of citizens.
The Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019 has added a new provision – Article 16(6) where the state may make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favor of any economically weaker sections of citizens in addition to the existing reservation and subject to a maximum of 10 percent.
The reservation of up to 10% for “economically weaker sections” in educational institutions and public employment will be in addition to the existing reservation.
 
Article 17: Abolition of Untouchability
“Untouchability” and its practice in any shape or form have been outlawed by the provisions of the Untouchability (Offenses) Act, of 1955, and have been recognized as a punishable offense.
Untouchability should not be understood verbatim rather it has a wider connotation as it can be traced back from its history.
It’s an absolute right which means there is no exception bonded to this article.
The Supreme Court alleged that the right under Article 17 is available against private individuals and it is the Constitutional obligation of the State to take necessary action to ensure that this right is not violated.
Article 18: Abolition of Titles
No title, other than a military or academic distinction shall be granted by the State;
No citizen of India shall acknowledge any title from any foreign state; and
A foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under the state cannot accept any title from any foreign state without the consent of the president.
Without the approval of the President, no individual holding an office of profit or trust office under the State can accept any present emolument or office of any kind from or under any foreign State.
However, the Constitutional validity of the National Awards (Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri) have been upheld by the honorable Supreme Court but there are reasonable restrictions over these titles i.e. should not be used as suffixes, or prefixes to the names of awardees. Otherwise, the awards shall be forfeited.
3.Right to Freedom: (Articles 19-22)
It contains the right to freedom which is considered as the heart of the Indian Constitution as it gives basic and vital rights to the citizens of India.
 
Article 19: Article 19 assures all citizens the six rights and they are as follows:
Article (a): Right to freedom of speech and expression.
Article (b): Right to assemble peacefully and without arms.
Article (c): Right to form associations or unions or co-operative societies. However, the right to acquire recognition of the association is not a fundamental right. The Supreme Court alleged that the trade unions have no guaranteed right to effective bargaining or right to strike or right to announce a lockout. The right to strike can be managed by an appropriate industrial law.
Article (d): Right to move freely all through the territory of India. The freedom of movement has two magnitudes, viz.
Internal (right to move within the country) Article 19 guards this.
External (right to move out of the country and right to come back to the country) Article 21 guards this.
Article (e): Right to reside and settle in any fraction of the territory of India.
Article (g): Right to practice any profession or to take on any trade, occupation or business.
Restrictions: The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the freedom of speech and expression on the grounds of:
Sovereignty and integrity of India,
Security of the state,
Friendly relations with overseas states,
Public order,
Decency or morality,
Contempt of court,
Defamation and
Incitement to an offense.
Also, note that the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only when a National Emergency is announced on the grounds of war or external aggression (i.e., external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion (i.e. internal emergency).
 
Article 20: Protection in Respect for Conviction for Offences

Article 20 provides the protection of citizens in respect of conviction for offenses. It guarantees immunity from a conviction for offences on the following grounds:

1. Retrospective criminal legislation: This is also known as ex-post-facto criminal legislation. Any individual can be convicted only for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act.
This means that criminal statutes cannot be applied retrospectively.
This immunity does not extend to preventive arrest and it also does not apply to the tribunal.
An individual cannot be subjected to a penalty that is greater than what is required by statute for the offence committed. For example, In the Nirbhaya case, there was a demand to alter the law for giving capital punishment to juveniles, but criminal law cannot be modified amid this legislation.
2. Double jeopardy: This specifies that a person cannot be convicted for the same offence more than once.
 
3. No self-incrimination: Article 20(3) entails the protection against self- incrimination extends to both oral evidence and documentary evidence. Nevertheless, it does not extend to (i) compulsory exhibition of the body, (ii) compulsion to give specimen signature, thumb impression, blood specimens, and (iii) compulsory production of material objects.
 
Article 21: Protection of life and personal liberty
Article 21 declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except
according to procedures established by law.
It is available to both citizens and non-citizens.
Goplana case (1950): Protection under Article 21 is available only against arbitrary
executive action and not from arbitrary legislative action.
Menaka case (1978): The right to life and personal liberty of a person can be deprived by the law provided the procedure prescribed by that law is reasonable, fair, and just.
Rights included under Article 21
Right to live with human dignity; Right to a decent environment including pollution-free water and air and protection against hazardous industries.
Right to livelihood; Right to shelter; Right to health; Right to free education up to 14 years of age; Right to free legal aid; Right against solitary confinement; Right to a speedy trial; Right against custodial harassment; Right to emergency medical aid; Right to timely medical treatment in a government hospital; Right of women to be treated with decency and dignity; Right against public hanging; Right of appeal from a judgment of conviction; Right to social security and protection of the family; Right to social and economic justice and empowerment; Right to sleep; Right to freedom from noise pollution, Right to electricity and Right to Privacy.
Right to education (Article 21-A):
It envisages free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 6 to 14 years to be granted by the state. Hence, this provision makes only elementary education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education.
The Ramamurthy committee in the 1992 program of action projected the need for compulsory education.
Later in 1993, J. P. Unnikrishnan Vs. The state of Andhra Pradesh paved the way for providing the necessary infrastructure for primary education.
In pursuance of Article 21-A, the Parliament passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. (86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002).
Article 22: Protection against arbitrary arrest and detention
Article 22 envisages protection for persons under both kinds of detention namely, punitive and preventive.
Punitive detention: to punish a person after conviction for an offence in a court.
Preventive detention: Detention of a person lacking trial and conviction by a court. i.e. to prevent a person from committing a crime in the future.
After an individual has been arrested, this right comes into play. It is not a fundamental right to be free of detention and arrest; rather, the objective of this right is to avoid arbitrary detention and arrest.
The article provides the following safeguards:
Article 22(1): Any person detained must be told of the reason for his detention. Furthermore, he cannot be refused the right to speak with an attorney.
Supreme Court in Joginder Kumar Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh 1994 case entailed for informing the arrested person and it is ground for his arrest
Article 22(2): Within 24 hours of his detention, the accused person should be produced before a judicial magistrate.
Article 22(3): No person who has been detained can be held in custody for longer than the judicial magistrate has decided.
4.Rights against Exploitation (Articles 23 and 24)
 
Article 23: Prohibition of Traffic in human beings and forced labour
This Act outlaws traffic in human beings, beggars (forced labour), and other similar forms of forced labour.
An individual is protected from the State as well as private persons.
Parliament has promulgated the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, and the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 to punish for such traffic.
Exception
Compulsory service for public purposes has been kept out of the purview of this prohibition. For instance, social service or military service for which it is not bound to pay.
However, while imposing such service, the State should be unbiased with respect to the selection or recruitment on the grounds of race, religion, caste, or class.
Article 24: Prohibition of employment of children in factories, mines, etc.
As per this Article, children less than 14 years of age are prohibited from working in any factory, mines, or other hazardous activities like construction work or railway. However, a child can be employed in any harmless or innocent work.
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, of 1986, is the most significant law in this direction.
This was a landmark law passed to combat the pervasive problem of child labour in India. It specified when and how children could be working, as well as when and how this was prohibited.
A child is described as a person who has not yet completed his or her 14th year of age. The 1986 Act forbids children from serving in 13 professions and 57 processes.
Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
This Act completely forbids the employment of children below 14 years of age.
It also prohibits individuals between the ages of 14 and 18 from working in hazardous occupations or procedures. This amendment act increased the severity of the penalties for those who break the rule.
The children are allowed to be employed in convinced family occupations and also as artists provided their education is not hampered.
Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2017
In 2017, the government released the above Rules in order to include a broad and detailed structure for child and adolescent labour’s prevention, prohibition, rescue and rehabilitation.
The Rules explained concerns relating to the jobs of family businesses, as well as providing protection for artists by defining working hours and conditions.
5.Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25 – 28)
 
Article 25: Freedom of Conscience and free profession, practice and Propagation of Religion
It envisages the Right to choose one’s own religion i.e. freedom of conscience followed by Right to profess, practice, and propagate their religion.
Article 25 incorporates the following explanations:
1. The Sikhs are allowed to wear and carry kirpans.
2. In this sense, Hindus means Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists.
According to the Supreme Court guidelines Right to propagate should not coincide with the Right to convert.
Although voluntary conversion is permitted under Article 25 and laws can be made against forced conversion as in the case of M.P., Orissa, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu have been legislated by making forced conversion a penal offence.
Article 26: Freedom to manage religious affairs
It provides for every religious denomination or a section of it to set up and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and manage their religious affairs.
They might also acquire and own movable and immovable properties and administer such properties in accordance with the law.
According to the Supreme Court, a religious denomination must meet three criteria:
It should be a group of people who share a set of values (doctrines) that they believe are beneficial to their spiritual well-being;
It should have a common organization; and
It should have a distinct name.
Article 27: Freedom from Taxation for the Promotion of a Religion
No one shall be forced to pay any taxes if the proceeds are used to pay for expenditures related to the propagation or preservation of a specific religion or religious denomination.
It means that the state shall not raise a religious tax and also that the state cannot spend its secular taxes for any particular religion as it would go against its secular character.
This means that the taxes might be used for the promotion or maintenance of all religions.
A fee can be levied on pilgrims by the government to offer them some special service or safety measures. In the same way, a fee might be levied on religious endowments for meeting the regulation expenditure.
Article 28: Freedom from attendance of religious instructions or worship in educational institutions:
Article 28 claims to distinguish between various forms of educational institutions:
Institutions maintained by the State completely.
Institutions administered by the State but recognized under any endowment or trust.
Institutions recognized by the State.
Institutions receiving aid from the State.
Religious instruction is completely prohibited in (a), while religious instruction is allowed in (b). Religious instruction is allowed on a voluntary basis in (c) and (d).
 
6.Educational and Cultural Rights (Articles 29 and 30)

Article 29: Protection of Interests of Minorities
Article 29(1) envisages all citizen groups that reside in India having a distinct culture, language, and script, shall have the right to conserve their culture and language.
It is an Absolute right and there are no ‘reasonable restrictions’ in the concern of the general public here.
Article 29(2): The State shall not refuse admission into educational institutes maintained by it or those that receive aids from it to any person on the basis of race, religion, caste, language, etc. This right is agreed to by individuals and not any community.
Article 29 awards protection to both religious minorities as well as linguistic minorities. This Article upholds the spirit of “Unity in Diversity”.
As per the Supreme Court, this Article is not just confined to Minorities as commonly presumed. Since the words ‘section of citizens’ as mentioned in the Article shall encompass both minority as well as majority.
Article 30: Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational Institutions
It provides the following rights to minorities, whether religious or linguistic.
All minorities might have the right to set up and administer educational institutions of their choice.
The State’s compensation sum for the forced acquisition of any property of a minority educational institution shall not limit or abrogate the right guaranteed to them. This clause was introduced by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 to protect minorities’ rights in this regard. The Act removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right (Article 31).
In awarding aid, the State shall not discriminate against any educational institution managed by a minority.
Article 30 is limited to minorities only (religious or linguistic) and unlike Article 29.
Extension of aid by the State does not change the nature and character of the minority educational institutions. The conditions shall be imposed by the State to ensure proper utilization of the aid, without however diluting or abridging the right under Article 30 (1).
7.Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)
Rights without remedies for violation of those rights are meaningless. Thus, Article 32 talks about the right to remedies for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen.
The right to get Fundamental Rights secured is in itself a fundamental right. This makes fundamental rights real.
Dr. B. R. Ambedkar described this article as the very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it.
The Supreme Court has alleged that Article 32 is a basic feature of the Constitution.
What is a Writ?
 
A writ is an order given by the Supreme Court and High Courts of India to carry out their orders for the execution of the affected person’s fundamental right and/or legal right. The Supreme Court can issue writs under Article 32 of the Constitution whereas the High Courts can issue writs under Article 226.
 
Type of Writs and their Capacity
 
The writs issued may comprise habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, and certiorari, and quo warranto.
 
Habeas Corpus
This means “to have the body of” i.e. to present an arrested or detained person before the court(illegal detention).
It can be issued against both public and private individuals.
Issued to inform the court of the reasons for his detention and to explain the ‘day and cause’ of his detention.
It is the most effective way to defend individual liberty from arbitrary detention by any executive authority.
Habeas Corpus is a prerogative writ that applies equally to all aggrieved parties. The aggrieved party, or someone acting on their behalf, may petition the court for the issuance of this writ.
Mandamus
Mandamus means- ‘We Command’.
Provided to governmental or semi-governmental or judicial bodies: inferior court, tribunal, board, corporation, or person required to perform their respective duties which they have either willingly or unwillingly refused to perform as fixed by law.
The writ can be issued only to impose the mandatory legal duty, not a discretionary function.
It shall not be issued to a private individual.
Certiorari
A superior court may issue an order directing an inferior court or tribunal to transmit the records of a case or matter that is pending before them.
An inferior court’s decision is nullified if it is found to be without authority or in violation of natural justice standards.
Its object is to protect that the jurisdiction of an inferior court or tribunals is properly exercised.
Unlike Habeas Corpus, it should be used only by the person aggrieved, not by any other person.
Prohibition
Prohibition is provided by the Supreme Court or a High Court to an inferior court, preventing it from dealing with a case that falls outside of its jurisdiction.
It is only applicable when the inferior court or tribunal has not yet reached a decision. Certiorari can be granted even after a decision has been reached by the court or tribunal.
Prohibition wholly deals with matters of jurisdictional defects, whereas Certiorari is only substantially concerned with such defects.
The remedies under both Prohibition and Certiorari fall against a judicial or quasi-judicial body, not against an executive body.
Thus the writ of prohibition is opposite to the mandamus in so far as unlike the mandamus that directs activity, the writ of prohibition directs inactivity.
Quo-Warranto
Means “by what authority”.
It is issued by the court to investigate the validity of a person’s appointment to a public office in order to avoid the person’s unlawful occupation of the office.
The writ of quo-warranto can be provided only in case of a substantive public office of a permanent character shaped by a statute or by the Constitution. It shall not be issued in cases of ministerial office or private office.
8.Other Articles
Article 33

By law, the Parliament shall limit or abolish Fundamental Rights in the application to:
The members of the Paramilitary Forces, Armed Forces, intelligence agencies, and police forces.
The forces involved in the maintenance of public order.
The prerogative to make laws under this article lies only with the Parliament and not the state legislatures. Laws made under it shall not be challenged in any court of law for their violation of fundamental rights.
A parliamentary law passed under Article 33 can also exclude the Court Martials (tribunals established under Military law) from the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and High Court, so far as the enforcement of Fundamental Rights is concerned.
 
Article 34
It provides for the restriction of the fundamental laws when Martial law is imposed in any of the parts of the country.
The Supreme Court said that the declaration of martial law does not ipso facto result in the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
It provides immunity to any public servant or any such person against actions taken during the operation of Martial law.
Article 35
Article 35 states that only the Parliament, not the state legislatures, has the power to make laws and give effect to those specific fundamental rights.
Article 16(3), 32(3), 33, and 34: matters pertaining to these articles are the prerogative of the Parliament only.
Any legislation in effect immediately prior to the adoption of this Constitution to be made under Article 372 can only be amended by the Parliament.
9.Exceptions to Fundamental Rights: Article 31A, Article 31B & Article 31C

Article 31A

Saves five categories of Laws from beings challenged and invalidated on the ground of contravention of FRs conferred by Article 14 and Article 19. They are related to agricultural lands reforms, industry, and commerce and include
Acquisition of estates and related rights by the state
Taking over the management of properties by the State
Amalgamation of corporations
Extinguishment or modification of rights of directors or shareholders of corporations.
Does not immunize a state from judicial review unless an Act under it has been reserved
for the President’s consideration and has received her assent.
Compensation has to be paid at market value when the state acquires that land held by the person under her personal cultivation, and the land is within the statutory ceiling limit.
 
Article 31B
Saves acts and regulations in the 9th Schedule from being challenged and invalidated on grounds of contravention of FRs.

4. Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) & Fundamental Duties

These are non-justiciable (i.e. not enforceable in courts) but serve as guiding principles for how the State should function. They aim to ensure social welfare, justice etc. (this content can add depth after Fundamental Rights).

Fundamental Duties: added later (42nd Amendment) - citizens’ duties to help uphold Constitution, respect national ideals etc.

5. Amendments & Evolution

The Constitution is not static. It has been amended many times to adapt to changing needs. For example:

42nd Amendment (1976) — added “Socialist”, “Secular”, “Integrity” to Preamble; added Fundamental Duties; during emergency.

101st Amendment (2016) — Goods and Services Tax (GST) unified tax system. 
Outlook India

103rd Amendment (2019) — 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in public jobs and educational institutions. 
Outlook India

Also, the legal/interpretative evolution via Supreme Court judgments (e.g. basic structure doctrine via Kesavananda Bharati, interpretation of Fundamental Rights, etc.)
